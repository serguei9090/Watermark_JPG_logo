# [Watermark_JPG_logo]("Watermark JPG With Logo")
This Bat Script Watermark JPG with logo of clients, is useful for batch process.

To use it you need the folder structure and the cli programs:

> [ffmpeg.exe](https://ffmpeg.org/ "FFmpeg")

>MediaInfo.exe (this one come with the program)

I also developed another Script for Video, just need some tune.
And there are another one for batch video procesing that actualy is in production for join the spot video at the end of the video and put one third video on the videos.
